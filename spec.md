Certainly! Here's a **comprehensive, developer-ready specification** for the Telegram bot, covering all the aspects we’ve discussed.

---

## **Telegram Speech-to-Text Bot Specification**

### **Overview**

This bot will be deployed on a **Raspberry Pi 3 (4GB)** and will transcribe **Russian voice messages** sent within a **single Telegram group chat**. The transcription will be done using **OpenAI Whisper** with the goal of providing high accuracy, responding with the transcribed text directly to the sender of each voice message. The bot will be deployed in a **Docker container** to simplify dependency management and ensure a portable and maintainable setup.

---

### **Core Features**

1. **Telegram Group Integration**:
   - The bot listens to a **single regular group chat** (no multi-chat support).
   - It will **only process voice messages** (in Russian) sent by users within the group.

2. **Speech-to-Text Conversion**:
   - **Whisper** (specifically the `small` model) will be used for speech-to-text conversion, chosen for a balance between **accuracy** and **performance** on the Raspberry Pi 3.
   - Supported audio format: **OGG (Opus codec)**, as Telegram voice messages use this format.

3. **Response Mechanism**:
   - Upon successful transcription, the bot will **reply directly to the voice message** with the transcribed text in Russian.
   - If transcription fails due to poor audio quality or another error, the bot will reply with:  
     > "Извините, не удалось распознать речь."

4. **Deployment**:
   - The bot will be deployed inside a **Docker container** on the Raspberry Pi 3.
   - The bot will be started as a **Python script** running inside the container.

5. **Logging**:
   - Logs will be output to **stdout** and stored temporarily in **log files** for debugging and troubleshooting.
   - Logs should include:
     - Errors in processing (e.g., failure to transcribe).
     - Bot status (e.g., start-up, shut-down, etc.).
     - Critical errors such as crashes.

6. **Admin Notifications**:
   - If a **critical error** occurs (such as a bot crash), the bot will notify the **admin** via a private Telegram chat.
   - This is the only instance of notification; no notifications for minor errors.

7. **Privacy and Data Handling**:
   - **No data storage**: The bot will not store voice messages or transcriptions permanently.
   - It will only process and reply to the voice message in real-time, then discard the data.
   - **Log files** will be temporary, stored for the duration of the bot’s operation, and discarded afterward.

### **Architecture and Technology Choices**

- **Telegram Bot Library**:  
  - Use `python-telegram-bot` (or similar) to interface with the Telegram API.
  
- **Speech-to-Text Engine**:
  - Use **Whisper** (the `small` model) for transcription. This model is selected to balance accuracy with performance on the Raspberry Pi 3.
  
- **Audio Processing**:
  - Use `ffmpeg` (if necessary) or an existing audio library (e.g., `pydub`) to handle **audio conversion** to a compatible format (if needed).
  
- **Docker**:
  - The bot will be packaged in a **Docker container** to ensure the environment is consistent, manageable, and easily deployable.

- **Logging**:
  - Logs will be written to `stdout` and saved temporarily in log files.
  - Use Python’s built-in `logging` library for structured logging.

### **Detailed Data Handling**

- **Input**:  
  - The bot will receive voice messages in **OGG format (Opus codec)** from users within the group chat.
  
- **Processing**:  
  - Audio data will be passed to **Whisper** for transcription. The bot will assume all voice messages are in **Russian**.
  
- **Output**:
  - The bot will send a **text reply** containing the transcription of the audio back to the sender.
  
- **Error Handling**:  
  - If Whisper fails (e.g., unclear audio or format issue), the bot will reply with:  
    > "Извините, не удалось распознать речь."

- **Log Files**:
  - Logs will be stored temporarily to facilitate debugging and monitoring.

---

### **Error Handling Strategy**

1. **General Errors**:
   - Minor issues (e.g., Telegram API errors) will be logged, and the bot will continue operation.
   - If Whisper fails to transcribe, the bot will return a message to the user:  
     > "Извините, не удалось распознать речь."

2. **Critical Failures (e.g., crashes)**:
   - On a crash, the bot will send a **critical error notification** to the admin's Telegram account.
   
3. **Audio Processing Errors**:
   - The bot will attempt to handle and gracefully recover from **audio format** issues (e.g., if the voice message is corrupted or the format is unsupported).
   - In case of issues, it will notify the user with an appropriate failure message.

---

### **Testing Plan**

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test individual components:
     - Transcription functionality using Whisper (for a variety of Russian voice samples).
     - Error handling (test scenarios where the audio is unintelligible, too short, or corrupted).
     - Test the bot’s interaction with Telegram’s API (sending and receiving messages).

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test the complete pipeline:
     - Sending a voice message, transcribing it, and receiving the correct transcription.
     - Handle failure scenarios: No audio, unclear speech, or crash during processing.
   
3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Test the bot’s response time to ensure it processes voice messages under **30 seconds** in **less than 1 minute** (target performance).
   
4. **Deployment Tests**:
   - Verify that the bot can be successfully built and deployed in a **Docker container** on the Raspberry Pi 3.
   - Ensure the bot runs as expected with minimal resource usage.

5. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Set up a test Telegram group with a few participants and verify that the bot correctly processes voice messages, transcribes them, and responds to the sender.

### **Security and Privacy Considerations**

- The bot will ensure **no data persistence** beyond the live operation:
  - No voice messages or transcriptions will be stored beyond the point of processing.
  
- Since the bot only handles **voice data in real-time**, no personal data is retained by the bot beyond necessary processing.

---

### **Deployment Instructions**

1. **Setting up Telegram Bot**:
   - Create the bot on Telegram via [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) and retrieve the bot token.
   - Disable **privacy mode** in the BotFather settings to allow the bot to read messages in the group.

2. **Docker Setup**:
   - Create a **Dockerfile** that installs all required dependencies (Python libraries, Whisper, ffmpeg).
   - Build and run the container on the Raspberry Pi 3.
   
3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Set up the bot token and any configuration settings as environment variables or in a configuration file.
   
4. **Running the Bot**:
   - Start the bot in the Docker container.
   - Monitor logs via `stdout` or by accessing the log files temporarily stored in the container.

### **Conclusion**

This specification outlines the complete design, functionality, architecture, and deployment plan for the Telegram speech-to-text bot. With these details, a developer should be able to begin implementation immediately.
